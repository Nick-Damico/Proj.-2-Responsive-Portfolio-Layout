** Treehouse | Front End Techdegree Project: 2 Responsive Layout **

  https://nick-damico.github.io/Proj.-2-Responsive-Portfolio-Layout/

INSTRUCTIONS : In this project you'll build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The design should respond to small, medium, and large viewport sizes and devices; and demonstrate an understanding of responsive design.

You will write basic layout styles to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using media queries, add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
